Z5D ADVERSARIAL TEST SUITE - FINAL RESULTS
================================================================================

TEST DATE: 2025-12-16
TESTER: GitHub Copilot CLI
CHALLENGE: Adversarial validation of Z5D factorization

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

**COMPLETE FAILURE across all test cases.**

- Tested: 6 RSA challenge numbers + 20 random semiprimes = 26 total
- Success: 0/26 (0%)
- Median enrichment: 0.00× (factors not found in top-100K)

**Verdict: N₁₂₇ was lucky/overfit. Z5D approach does not generalize.**

================================================================================
KEY FINDING: Z5D SCORES LACK DISCRIMINATORY POWER  
================================================================================

RSA-100 Example:
  True factor p:      Z5D score = -5.621549
  True factor q:      Z5D score = -5.622281
  Random candidates:  Z5D score = -5.621 ± 0.001
  
  **Score variation: 0.02% (within numerical noise)**
  
Factors are INDISTINGUISHABLE from random candidates in Z5D score space.

SUCCESS CRITERIA EVALUATION
================================================================================

PASS Requirements:
  ✗ Phase 1 median ≥ 3×         [Got: 0.00×]
  ✗ Phase 2 median ≥ 5×         [Got: 0.00×]
  ✗ ≥4 RSA challenges >2×       [Got: 0/6]

FAIL Indicators:

  ✓ Phase 2 median < 3×         [Got: 0.00×]
  ✓ >2 RSA challenges <1.5×     [Got: 6/6]

Result: Meets ALL failure criteria, ZERO pass criteria

================================================================================
WHY N₁₂₇ APPEARED TO WORK
================================================================================

1. Overfitting: Parameters tuned to single test case
2. Confirmation bias: No independent validation  
3. Lucky candidate set: Specific k-value included factors by chance
4. Small sample size: n=1 is not statistically meaningful

**N₁₂₇ was a FALSE POSITIVE.**

================================================================================
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

If Z5D scores provided signal:
  - Expected: ~10-50% of factors in top-100K
  - Observed: 0% of factors in top-100K
  - Probability by chance: p < 0.001

This is HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT evidence of NO SIGNAL.

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================

Scoring Rate:     ~13,000 candidates/second
Candidates Tested: 2,600,000 total
Factors Found:    0
Time per Test:    ~7-8 seconds (scoring phase)

Fast execution, zero results.

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE UPDATE
================================================================================

Original Prediction:
  - 35% confidence in PASS outcome
  - 65% confidence in FAIL outcome
  - Predicted: "N₁₂₇ was likely overfit"

Post-Test Reality:
  - 0% success rate across 26 tests
  - Score variation within numerical noise
  - No evidence of exploitable structure

Updated Confidence:
  - <5% that Z5D approach has merit for factorization
  - >95% that N₁₂₇ was statistical artifact
  - Recommendation: DO NOT pursue disclosure

================================================================================
WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

For Z5D to work as factorization method:

1. Score variance 100-1000× larger than observed
2. Monotonic relationship: better score → closer to factor
3. Reproducible across different semiprimes
4. Theoretical justification for prime index structure
5. Beat random search by significant margin

NONE of these conditions are met.

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR N₁₂₇
================================================================================

Possible reasons for original "success":

1. **Measurement error**: Factors were in candidate set by construction
2. **Lucky search range**: Happened to cover factors by chance  
3. **Selective reporting**: Only reported positive result
4. **Implementation artifact**: Bug that happened to help
5. **Misunderstanding**: May have been testing something else

Without seeing original N₁₂₇ code, hard to determine exact cause.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Researcher:
  ✓ Accept falsification of Z5D approach
  ✓ Do NOT pursue cryptographic disclosure
  ✓ Document N₁₂₇ as interesting false positive
  ✓ Move to different research direction

For Future Work:
  ✓ Always validate on multiple independent cases
  ✓ Use adversarial test suites from start
  ✓ Compare against random baseline
  ✓ Require statistical significance (p < 0.01)
  ✓ Separate training/validation/test sets

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Per original challenge criteria:

  "FAIL (N₁₂₇ was lucky/overfit): 
   - Phase 1: Median enrichment < 2×
   - Phase 2: Median enrichment < 3×  
   - More than 2 RSA challenges show <1.5× enrichment"

**ALL FAILURE CONDITIONS MET.**

Confidence downgraded from 35% → <5% as predicted.

Z5D factorization approach is **FALSIFIED**.
